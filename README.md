## Idea
The core idea is to create a Python-based file system that can be used to store and retrieve files from a remote server. This, unlike the original, is based on being built around an API. A filesystem will be created, using SQL, with a database facing end. This time, each feature will be implemented in a directly to a API, for ease of use.

## API Functions
* [] List Filesystem: _"listfs"_ (List the contents of the Filesystem)
* [] Create Directory: _"makedir"_ (Create a new directory, at a set location)
* [] Remove Directory: _"rmdir"_ (Remove an existing directory)
* [] Upload File: _"upload"_ (Upload a file to the server)
* [] Download File: _"download"_ (Download a file from the server)
* [] Remove File: _"delete"_ (Set a file as deleted)
* [] Copy File: _"copy"_ (Copy a file to a new location)
* [] Move File: _"move"_ (Move a file to a new location)
